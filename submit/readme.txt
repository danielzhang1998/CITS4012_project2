project_2_task_1.ipynb include the part that how we use original data set (seek_australia.csv) to get the data set we use to do CNN models etc. and task2. 
So, please make sure you have seek_australia.csv in the same folder. Since it is offered in the project description, so here won't upload it again.

output.csv is the data set after pre-processing. Simply remove the content that how we produce output.csv is also a good way to run the .ipynb files 
without file not exists bug if you have no seek_australia.csv in current folder.

For the task2, since here we upload output.csv, so it is able to run directly.
